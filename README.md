Time Series Forecasting with Machine Learning
Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform time series forecasting using machine learning techniques. It focuses on predicting future energy consumption using historical hourly data. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Project Highlights
Utilizes hourly energy consumption data

Applies machine learning models for time-based forecasting

Includes feature engineering specific to temporal datasets (e.g., hour of day, day of week)

Compares model performance using appropriate metrics

Visualizes actual vs. predicted values for model interpretation

Key Concepts
Time series decomposition and seasonality

Lag features and rolling statistics

Train-test split based on time

Evaluation metrics like MAE, RMSE, and RÂ²
